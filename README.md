 This paper presents a comparative study on multi-class bird species classification using
 the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB-200) dataset. Three models — ResNet-50,
 EfficientNet-B3, and Vision Transformer (ViT-8) — are evaluated on this fine-grained
 classification task. Performance is assessed using Top-1 accuracy and Average
 Accuracy per Class, highlighting each model’s strengths and weaknesses. The results
 offer insights into the trade-offs between convolutional networks and transformer-based
 architectures for species classification with limited training data
